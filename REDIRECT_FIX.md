# ðŸ”§ Fix for Auto-Redirect to `/setup` Issue

## Problem
When opening `localhost:3000`, the app automatically redirects to `http://localhost:3000/setup` instead of staying on the main page.

## Root Cause
The routing logic was checking `needsProfileSetup` and redirecting to `/setup` even when there were database connection errors or loading issues. The condition was:

```typescript
needsProfileSetup: isSignedIn && !loading && !appUser
```

This meant that ANY time a user couldn't be loaded from Supabase (due to errors, network issues, etc.), it would trigger the setup redirect.

## Fixes Applied âœ…

### 1. **Improved Routing Logic**
- Added better conditions to only redirect to setup when truly needed
- Added loading state checks to prevent premature redirects
- Added error state checks to avoid redirects due to connection issues

### 2. **Enhanced `needsProfileSetup` Logic** 
```typescript
// OLD (problematic):
needsProfileSetup: isSignedIn && !loading && !appUser

// NEW (fixed):
needsProfileSetup: isSignedIn && !loading && !appUser && !error
```

### 3. **Better Loading States**
- Show loading spinner while user data is being fetched
- Don't redirect until both Clerk and Supabase data are fully loaded

### 4. **Debug Tools Added**
- `/debug-user` - Shows current user state and debugging info
- Better console logging to understand what's happening

## Testing the Fix

### Step 1: Test Normal Flow
1. Open `localhost:3000`
2. Should stay on main page (not redirect to `/setup`)
3. If signed in with valid profile, should show dashboard
4. If not signed in, should show role selection page

### Step 2: Debug Information
If you're still getting redirected, visit:
- `localhost:3000/debug-user` - See current user state
- Check browser console for detailed logging

### Step 3: Expected Behavior Now
- **Not signed in**: Redirects to `/select-role` 
- **Signed in + has profile**: Shows main dashboard
- **Signed in + needs setup**: Shows setup page (only if truly needed)
- **Database errors**: Shows main app with error handling (no redirect loop)

## If Issues Persist

1. **Clear browser data** for localhost:3000
2. **Check console logs** for specific errors
3. **Visit `/debug-user`** to see current state
4. **Manually go to dashboard** using the debug tools

## Manual Override
If you get stuck in redirect loops, you can:
- Visit `localhost:3000/debug-user` 
- Use the "Go to Dashboard" button to bypass redirects
- Or clear browser storage and start fresh

The app now handles edge cases much better and won't get stuck in redirect loops due to database connection issues.
